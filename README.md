=====================================

What is BGL?
----------------

BGL is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. BGL uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. BGL Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

#### Specifications

Essentially this is a full bitcoin fork, but:
```
* Block Reward  = nFees * 0.1 + GetBlockSubsidy() // Burn rate is 90% of tx fees
* Block Weight <= 400,000;                        // 10 times smaller than bitcoin
* 100% Segwit                                     // Eliminates problems with legacy types of transactions
* Halving Interval = 210000 blocks / 4;           // Halving is every year (bitcoin halving is every 4 years)
* Block Subsidy = 50 * 4;                         // 21 000 000 coins max
* Hashing algorithm for blocks is Keccak (sha-3).
